## Dataset

> Provide basic information about your dataset in this section. If you selected your own dataset, make sure you note the source of your data and summarize any data wrangling steps that you performed before you started your exploration.

In this project we will explore and analyse the loans data from Prosper in Quarter 4 of 2005 to Quarter 1 of 2014 (9 year period) in the USA.  The dataset is made up of 113 937 loans and 81 features stored ina CSV file.

The Prosper Loan Data is made up of the borrower credit profile, location, employment, income, payment history, loan information, borrower's credit score change over time as well as loan investment information. This project will demonstrate exploration through visuals of univariate and multivariate variables. 

The description of each column can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gDyi_L4UvIrLTEC6Wri5nbaMmkGmLQBk-Yx3z0XDEtI/edit#gid=0).

I transformed the column: LoanOriginationQuarter into 2 columns: Year and Quarter inorder so that I can explore and visualise the year feature.
